 Code In Place 2024 projects
Hey There! I am Kashmira Patil and this is a repository for my first "projects" in coding. I love coding and hence i decided to upgrade my skills and curiosity by Joining Code In Place 2024. I learnt so much of python on there. With new addtion of graphics and animation knowledge to my pre-existing python knowledge, i made two projects for the CodeInPlace 2024 showcase.
the first project is a digital clock. it is made using tkinter module with realtime.
the second project is a fidget spinner. it is made using turtle. how does this work? well, you keep ressing your space bar to make it spin and it will spin faster and faster. when you release your space bar, the spinner will eventually halt. 
thank you so much!!
